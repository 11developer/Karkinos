# What is Karkinos?
Karkinos is a light-weight 'Swiss Army Knife' for penetration testing and/or hacking CTF's. Currently, Karkinos offers the following:
* Encoding/Decoding characters
* Encrypting/Decrypting text or files
* Reverse shell handling

# System requirements
* Server to host PHP, tested with Apache Server 
* Tested with PHP 7.4.9
* Python3
* pip3
* Raspberry Pi Zero friendly :) (crack hashes at your own risk)

# Demo
## Home Menu
Landing page and quick access menu. <br> \
![Home 1](https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos/blob/main/screenshots/home.png) <br>

User stats are displayed here. Currently, the stats recorded are only the total hashes and hash types cracked successfully. <br> \
![Home 2](https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos/blob/main/screenshots/home2.png) <br>

## Encoding/Decoding
This page allows you to encode/decode in common formats (more may be added soon)  <br> \

## Encrypt/Decrypt
Encrypting and decrypting text or files is made easy and is fully trusted since it is done locally. <br> \

## Reverse Shell Handling
Reverse shells can be captured and interacted with on this page. Currently, this is being reworked to improve compatibility. <br>
### Create a listener instance

### Configure the listener

### Start the listener and capture a shell

## Generating Hashes
Karkinos can generate commonly used hashes such as:
* MD5
* SHA1
* SHA256
* SHA512
 <br> \
![Generating Hashes](https://github.com/helich0pper/Karkinos/blob/main/screenshots/convert.png) <br>

## Cracking Hashes
Karkinos offers the option to **simultaneously** crack hashes using a built-in wordlist consisting of over 15 million common and breached passwords. This list can easily be modified and/or completely replaced. <br> \

# Future Work
Karkinos is a new release and still needs significant work. Pull requests and bug reports are always appreciated. <br>
Below are known bugs and issues:
* Reverse shell server code is currently being reworked but it works fine
* Application is not yet responsive (best suitable for 1920x1080)
